Some UK Ordnance Survey coordinate conversions in pure ruby.

The code was originally written in JavaScrpt by Chris Veness:

And was originally realeased on the above site under LGPL license:
(c) Chris Veness 2005-2010
But is now released on the above site under CC-BY
(c) Chris Veness 2005-2012

Here the code has been ported to ruby by Harry Wood.
Harry waives all intelectual property rights which may apply to
the porting process, meaning the code is (c) Chris Veness as above.

Bundled into a RubyGem by Aaron B. Russell, who also waives any
copyright claims to this code. Thanks to Chris and Harry for saving
me from having to try and implement this from scratch! :)
